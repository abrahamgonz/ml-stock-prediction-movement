TITLE: MACHINE LEARNING APPLIED TO INTRA-DAY PRICE MOVEMENT PREDICTION OF MEXICAN STOCKS

Abstract:

As computers have taken on a more relevant role in decision-making in financial industry, particularly in stock trading, prediction models have become more accurate. However, forecasting accurately it is not an easy task due to the speculative nature of stock markets. The use of machine learning techniques is an increasingly frequent topic among researchers and investors, and the efficiency of the models has been growing over time. In this research, four supervised learning models are used to solve a binary classification problem, in which the aim is predicting the direction of movement of a stock in the next minute, taking as predictive variables the history of 30 days, in a 1-minute time resolution, of price, volume of operations and a set of 11 technical indicators. The same methodology was repeated for four assets: an Exchange Traded Fund that replicates the main index of the Mexican stock market, and the three most liquid shares listed in that same country. Logistic Regression model with variable selection through LASSO method broke the highest result, of 72.8\%, when considering Accuracy as performance measure, while the Decision Tree Classifier model, also with variable selection, broke the highest level, with 52.1\%, under the F1-Score metric.
